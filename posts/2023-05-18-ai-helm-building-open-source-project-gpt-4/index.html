Every so often I'd bang my head against <a href=https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt>ChatGPT</a>, and it usually gave me junk. I'd wander off grumbling things jaded engineers grumble.</p><p>Then I payed for OpenAI's <a href=https://openai.com/research/gpt-4>GPT-4</a> upgrade. GPT-4 actually seemed to work, so I decided to see how far I could push it. Could I write an entire open source project with GPT-4? Turns out, I could.</p><p>I had GPT-4 build me <a href=https://github.com/criccomini/twister>Twister</a>, a Java library that converts Avro and Protobuf data to and from Java POJOs. Nearly every element--code, docs, commit messages, tests, its README.md, even this blog post--was written by GPT-4.</p><p>This post isn't about Twister, though. It's about how I learned to use ChatGPT effectively to write not just tests and documentation, but code.</p><h2 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4>Key Lessons from Building with GPT-4</h2><p>Here's what I learned:</p><ul><li><strong>Start Small</strong>: Don't aim for complex features right away.</li><li><strong>Code, Test, Repeat</strong>: Follow the same patterns you use to write code.</li><li><strong>GPT-4 Forgets</strong>: Always re-paste the code you want to update.</li><li><strong>Show Changes Only</strong>: Helps you get answers faster. GPT-4 can be slow.</li><li><strong>Iterate</strong>: Don't write GPT-4 off at first mistake. Keep asking it to correct.</li><li><strong>Great for Grunt Work</strong>: GPT-4 shines with tests, docs, and commit messages.</li><li><strong>Best for 'Pure' Projects</strong>: Less business logic, like Twister, suits GPT-4.</li><li><strong>Keep GPT-3.5 Handy</strong>: Good for simpler tasks. Saves on GPT-4 quota.</li></ul><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_start-small>Start Small</h3><p>Break down tasks. Ask GPT-4 to build simple code changes at first. With Twister, I would have it build support for basic primitives (int, float, string, etc.) first. Once I got that working, I'd ask it to add support for complex types (maps, lists, enums, etc.).</p><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_code-test-repeat>Code, Test, Repeat</h3><p>The best pattern I found was:</p><ol><li>Ask GPT-4 to write code.</li><li>Ask GPT-4 to write a test for the code it'd written.</li><li>Ask GPT-4 to fix the failed test(s) if they don't pass.</li></ol><p>Flipping 1 and 2 (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development>TDD</a>) works, too</p><p>If you spot bugs, ask it to write tests exposing the bug. Then ask it to fix the test. The template I used for this loop was:</p><pre><code>Given this code:
...

And this test:
...

I get this error:
...

Can you fix this?
</code></pre><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_gpt-4-forgets>GPT-4 Forgets</h3><p>GPT-4 has a bad long-term memory. I found it did much better when I kept re-pasting my code into the prompt on ever iteration. There is a limit to the input size, so you have to get creative sometimes to fit relevant snippets in.</p><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_show-changes-only>Show Changes Only</h3><p>GPT-4 can be slow. To speed it up, request that it shows you only the code that's changed.</p><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_iterate>Iterate</h3><p>Don't dismiss GPT-4 at first error, even if it says silly things. Ask for corrections.</p><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_great-for-grunt-work>Great for Grunt Work</h3><p>GPT-4 excels at mundane tasks. I'm convinced everyone should use it for tests, doc strings, and commit messages.</p><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_best-for-pure-projects>Best for 'Pure' Projects</h3><p>Twister is a pretty pure computer science project; there isn't any real "business logic". I think GPT-4 does better at this kind of work.</p><h3 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_key-lessons-from-building-with-gpt-4_keep-gpt-3-5-handy>Keep GPT-3.5 Handy</h3><p>Use GPT-3.5 for simpler tasks. Saves you on your GPT-4 quota.</p><h2 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_why-not-github-copilot>Why Not Github Copilot?</h2><p>Copilot employs GPT-3.5. Compared to GPT-4, it is noticeably less effective. Copilot X offers improvements, yet it's tied to VisualStudio and VSCode. However, IntelliJ IDE is way more pleasant for Java than VSCode. So I just used ChatGPT. In the long run, IDE integration will certainly improve. Yet, for now, GPT-4 offered the optimal solution for Twister.</p><h2 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_future-work>Future work</h2><p>The Twister library is a small project right now. I want to add:</p><ul><li>Avro default support</li><li>Avro logical type support</li><li>Protobuf WKT support</li><li>Avro Record ➡️ Map wrapper</li><li>Protobuf Message ➡️ Map wrapper</li><li>.proto ➡️ Protobuf Descriptor converter</li><li>JDBC row ➡️ Map wrapper</li></ul><p>I'll continue having GPT write the code in this library. The experiment continues!</p><h2 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_conclusion>Conclusion</h2><p>Though this post is about building with GPT-4, I want to re-iterate that <a href=https://github.com/criccomini/twister>Twister</a> is a real project that I actually want people to use. It's a pretty cool library. If you're a Java developer dealing with Protobuf or Avro, check it out! Contributions are welcome, too (whether from GPT-4 or humans).</p><h2 id=ai-at-the-helm-building-an-entire-open-source-project-with-gpt-4_addendum>Addendum</h2><p>Here's the prompt I used to generate this blog post:</p><blockquote><p>The blog post should focus on my experience using GPT-4 to write an entire library.</p><p>The post should also talk about GPT-4 tricks I learned while building this project:</p><ul><li>Start small (don't ask GPT-4 to write all features in a class at once)</li><li>Ask GPT for a basic class, then ask it to write a test for the class. If the tests fail, tell GPT, and have it fix the tests. Then go back to the basic class and ask GPT-4 to add the next feature. Rinse and repeat.</li><li>Always re-paste the code you want GPT-4 to update. It has bad long-term memory. I frequently use a 2 part template: "Given this code: ... Can you update it to ..."</li><li>Tell it to just show changes, not the complete code. GPT-4 is slow, so telling it to skip unchanged code helps get you answers faster.</li><li>Don't be afraid to iterate. Many people get a response from GPT-4, and if it's wrong, they declare that it sucks. Instead, keep asking it to fix things.</li><li>GPT-4 is really good for grunt work (tests, docs, commit messages)</li><li>GPT-4 is also really good for more "pure" projects like Twister, where it doesn't have to understand a lot of business logic.</li><li>Keep a GPT-4 and a GPT-3.5 window open, so you can bounce to the GPT-3.5 window for more simple work. This will save you on your GPT-4 quota (currently 25 prompts per-3h window).</li></ul><p>The blog post style should be:</p><ol><li>Matter-of-fact.</li><li>No sentence should be more than 12 words.</li><li>Include links to external sites where appropriate.</li><li>Written in first-person.</li><li>The post should include a bullet-point list of the tips near the introduction.</li><li>The post should be written in markdown.</li><li>The post should include a catchy title that will get attention on Hacker news.</li><li>The post should include a section for each bullet point in the intro.</li><li>The intro should say that the the code, docs, git commit messages, tests, README.md, and even this blog post were all written with GPT-4.</li></ol></blockquote><p>I pasted in an rough outline with some notes before this prompt.</p><hr><h4>Changelog</h4><ul><li><strong>Fix redirects</strong> on February 11, 2025</li><li><strong>Migrate to markupdown (#1)</strong> on February 11, 2025</li></ul><hr><script async data-uid=9277dcb391 src=https://cnr.kit.com/9277dcb391/index.js></script></main><script defer src=https://tinylytics.app/embed/DsgFkjZH7dLkhSPiTKbn.js></script></body></html>
