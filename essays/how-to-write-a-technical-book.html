<h1>How to Write a Technical Book</h1>
<span class="by">Chris Riccomini on December 13, 2021</span>
</div>
<div class="article">
<p>I‚Äôve been asked for advice about writing a book several times since <a href="https://themissingreadme.com/">The Missing README</a> came out in August. This post is my attempt at an answer. If you‚Äôve ever thought about writing a book (or are just curious), read on.</p>
<h2 id="know-why-youre-writing">Know Why You‚Äôre Writing</h2>
<p>Writing a book is a long journey. You need to be clear about your motivation. I tell people, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt write a book because you can. Write a book because you can‚Äôt not.‚Äù Your motivation should be intrinsic. If you don‚Äôt have a very strong and enduring drive, you will fail.</p>
<p>A desire to learn, to help, to teach, to clarify or share an idea, to address a gap in the market; these are good motivations. Money and prestige are not good motivations. You‚Äôre <a href="https://martin.kleppmann.com/2020/09/29/is-book-writing-worth-it.html">not going to get rich</a> <a href="https://rothgar.medium.com/the-economics-of-writing-a-technical-book-689d0c12fe39">writing a technical book</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/squarecog">Dmitry Ryaboy</a> (my co-author) and I have found joy in the feedback and reviews we receive. It‚Äôs nice to know we‚Äôve helped people. This, alone, can go a long way in justifying why you write.</p>
<h2 id="assess-the-market">Assess the Market</h2>
<p>An intrinsic and enduring motivation to write isn‚Äôt enough. You need to answer two more questions: why does your book need to be written, and why does it need to be written by you? These are the two questions that publishers want answered. The following templates will help you find your answers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/16B8ZmpEj-DULGNb8X2NjpQPUnZMWUn5kM1ZBaN7pSUs/copy">O‚ÄôReilly Media‚Äôs Book Proposal Template</a></li>
<li><a href="https://nostarch.com/writeforus">No Starch‚Äôs Book Proposal Template</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Fill one of these templates out, even if you‚Äôre not planning to use O‚ÄôReilly or No Starch as your publisher.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs fine if there are books similar to yours; in fact, that‚Äôs a good signal that there‚Äôs a market. Your book does, however, need to differentiate itself in some way. You can differentiate by length, audience, author, style of prose, depth or focus of coverage, and so on. Maybe other books are academic and yours is applied. Perhaps other books are written by laymen and you‚Äôve got 20 years of experience. There are many ways to cut it, but you need to be clear about how your book will stand out.</p>
<p>You might not be an expert on everything you want to write about; this is fine. Dmitriy and I found ourselves doing research on some topics while we wrote, even though we were covering introductory material! Knowing something and being able to explain it are two very different levels of knowledge. The book was better for it.</p>
<p>Everything else you do will derive from what differentiates your book, so figure this out early. What sections you write about, what your table of contents looks like, the style of prose, how you market the book, the book‚Äôs cover, and so on.</p>
<h2 id="build-an-audience">Build an Audience</h2>
<p>Start a blog to test your determination and to assess the market. Put out a post every week or two for a sustained period‚Äìat least 3 months. If you can keep up this pace, it‚Äôs a sign you can sustain the pace needed to write a book.</p>
<p>The traffic to your blog will also signal whether there‚Äôs a market for your writing. If you‚Äôre putting out content and no one is reading it, your book is going to be harder to sell. It‚Äôs possible that no one is reading your posts because you don‚Äôt have distribution‚ÄìTwitter followers, LinkedIn followers, Hacker News upvotes, Reddit posts, and so on. This is still a valuable signal; you need to build these distribution channels while you write.</p>
<h2 id="find-a-publisher">Find a Publisher</h2>
<p>Find a publisher while blogging and writing your first few chapters. You can self-publish or go with a traditional publisher like O‚ÄôReilly or No Starch. Consider both paths before making a decision.</p>
<p>I have zero experience with self-publication, so my best advice is to talk to the community at <a href="https://techwriters.dev/">techwriters.dev</a>. The <em>TechWriters</em> Discord was founded by the inimitable Will Larson (a.k.a. <a href="https://lethain.com/">Lethain</a>, author of <a href="https://staffeng.com/book">Staff Engineer</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elegant-Puzzle-Systems-Engineering-Management/dp/1732265186">An Elegant Puzzle</a>). The community is a collection of both independent writers and bloggers, as well as traditionally published authors. You‚Äôll find a wealth of knowledge in this community.</p>
<p><em>NOTE: I post stats and other findings on #book-missingreadme, if you find the content in this post interesting.</em></p>
<p>Talk to more than one traditional publisher to get a feel for how they work. Pay close attention to the editing experience. A good editor will make your book much better. Our editor, Athabasca, improved our book in ways Dmitriy and I could never have. (If you‚Äôre self-publishing, definitely hire an editor.) Send each publisher a sample chapter and ask them to edit it. Evaluate both the editing process and the feedback you get.</p>
<p>Ask about distribution, too. Some publishers, like O‚ÄôReilly, are their own distributor; they manage relationships directly with retail book stores and Amazon. No Starch, by contrast, uses Penguin Random House as their distributor. If you think your audience wants ebooks, self-publication or O‚ÄôReilly might be better. Consider traditional distributors if you care more about print copies.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre willing to hustle, self-publication might be for you. You get more money per-book self-publishing, but you‚Äôll have to figure out the Amazon marketplace, Gumroad, ebooks, print publication, editing, sales, taxes, and much more. Publishers handle all of this for you.</p>
<p>If you want to focus on writing, a traditional publisher is probably better. They‚Äôll give you an editor, help with design and layout, and manage distribution. They‚Äôll take more of a cut, though. Take a look at No Starch‚Äôs royalty agreement <a href="https://nostarch.com/download/nspagreement-boilerplate-11-12-2020.pdf">here</a>: 15 percent royalty with no advance, 12 percent royalty with a $5,000 advance, or 10 percent royalty with an $8,000 advance.</p>
<p>Whether you self-publish or go with a traditional publisher, you can‚Äôt avoid marketing. Publishers just aren‚Äôt good at it. You‚Äôll have to leverage your network, social media, blog posts, presentations, and conferences to get the word out (assuming you want to drive sales up; not all authors care to).</p>
<h2 id="dont-fixate-on-writing-tools">Don‚Äôt Fixate on Writing Tools</h2>
<p>Dmitriy and I wasted a month fiddling with writing tools; don‚Äôt do this. Git, Google Docs, Markdown, AsciiDoc, Word, whatever. Pick one and get writing.</p>
<p>Most publishers tell you which tool they want you to use. O‚ÄôReilly has authors use their <a href="https://atlas.oreilly.com/">Atlas</a> tool. No Starch insists on Word or OpenDoc, and give you a template to use. If your publishers don‚Äôt have a preferred tool or you‚Äôre self-publishing, <a href="https://leanpub.medium.com/walkthrough-for-self-published-authors-how-to-write-and-publish-a-book-using-leanpubs-git-and-5473a3be56ea">pick something</a> <a href="https://gatekeeperpress.com/most-useful-self-publishing-software-for-authors/">off the shelf</a> and use it.</p>
<h2 id="establish-a-cadence">Establish a Cadence</h2>
<p>Writing a book takes a long time. Dmitriy and I naively thought we would write the book in a few months. The first few chapters flowed easily, ‚ÄúAt this pace, we‚Äôll have a draft in three months!‚Äù But writing a book was a lot like shipping software: the last 20% took 80% of the time (two years, in our case).</p>
<p>To get across the finish line, you need to establish a cadence. Force yourself to write every (week)day, no matter what. Writing a book is a daily endeavor. Don‚Äôt fool yourself into thinking you‚Äôre going to write in spurts (during vacation, on a specific month, and so on).</p>
<p>I wrote first thing in the morning with a big cup of coffee. The pandemic also helped‚Äìit completely eliminated my commute. I shuffled into my garage every morning and got straight to work. I tried to write at least half a page no matter what, even if it was junk. Some days I got a page or two, other days almost nothing.</p>
<p>My co-author, Dmitriy Ryaboy, and I wrote greedily at first. We grabbed whichever section inspired us the most. Our publisher encouraged us to write front to back, so we wrote in chapter batches (1-3, 4-7, etc). Batching chapters let us write one chapter while we edited a separate one.</p>
<p>Speaking of co-authors, conventional wisdom cautions against having a co-author, but collaborating with Dmitriy was fantastic. We cleared each other‚Äôs writer‚Äôs block, fed each other ideas, and edited each other‚Äôs work. Having someone to talk through problems and spitball ideas with is invaluable.</p>
<p>One caveat: Dmitriy and I both had extensive experience with open source, so it felt natural to collaborate remotely (we‚Äôve still never met in person!). Getting to a single voice was fine‚Äìwe edited each other relentlessly. I can‚Äôt speak to co-authors in general, but Dmitriy and I clicked nicely. You should definitely have Dmitriy as your co-author. ;)</p>
<h2 id="get-feedback">Get Feedback</h2>
<p>As you finish draft chapters, get feedback. Feedback always came to us from the editor first. Our editor was technical enough to give good writing and high-level technical feedback.</p>
<p>Secondary feedback came from a pool of past and current colleagues and friends. We sent our reviewers chapters after we‚Äôd done several rounds of editing with No Starch. Most of our reviewers would take a few weeks to get back to us, but it was great feedback.</p>
<p>The last layer of feedback came from No Starch‚Äôs book reviewers. The reviewers were surprisingly thoughtful and gave a lot of criticism. Many of the reviewers had strong points of view that we didn‚Äôt always agree with. We set a lot of this feedback aside, but there were still points that caused us to tweak a few sections.</p>
<h2 id="learn-to-write">Learn to Write</h2>
<p>I thought I knew how to write, then we got our first chapter back from the editor. I was taken aback by the amount of red ink on the chapter, and felt the edits made the writing dry.</p>
<p>After some reflection, I decided to give an honest effort to improving my writing. Three books were recommended to me: Strunk and White‚Äôs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elements-Style-Fourth-William-Strunk/dp/020530902X">Elements of Style</a>, Zinsser‚Äôs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548">On Writing Well</a>, and Stephen King‚Äôs <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Memoir-Craft-Stephen-King-ebook/dp/B000FC0SIM">On Writing</a>. Yes, two books have (basically) the same name; yes, it‚Äôs confusing.</p>
<p>You absolutely must read <em>On Writing Well</em>. Zinsser‚Äôs book changed the way I write. <em>On Writing Well</em> gives practical tips, and also discusses higher-level concepts. Again, <em>read this book</em>.</p>
<p><em>Elements of Style</em> is the canonical book everyone recommends, but I found it mediocre, dated. and scattershot. Given its short length, it‚Äôs still worth a skim, though.</p>
<p>Stephen King‚Äôs <em>On Writing</em> is a nice-to-have. It‚Äôs split into two sections: an autobiography and random writing tips. The autobiography is fun; King has had an interesting life. I didn‚Äôt read the second part because it looked like a worse version of <em>On Writing Well</em>.</p>
<h2 id="wrap-up">Wrap Up</h2>
<p>This post should get you to the point where you‚Äôve got a book that‚Äôs ready to publish. There‚Äôs a lot more to talk about‚Äìfonts, layouts, diagrams, covers, marketing, sales‚Äìbut those are best left to another post. Happy writing!</p>
