<h1>Trust, but automate</h1>

<div class="article">
<p>If you want to enforce a technical guideline or rule, you must
automate the enforcement mechanism. Relying on human beings to do the
enforcement is too error prone, yet this is exactly the pattern that I
see pop up again and again.</p>
<p>Suppose a team wants to define database schema rules. Things like
banning the use of BINARY in MySQL in favor of VARBINARY, or the
requirement for create and modify time columns in every table. It‚Äôs
surprising how a group of otherwise intelligent engineers will sit in a
room and agree that these are the required rules, and then go and
publish them on a page somewhere. ‚ÄúThere, done,‚Äù they say. Wrong.</p>
<h2 id="humans-arent-good-at-this">Humans aren‚Äôt good at this</h2>
<p>People aren‚Äôt perfect. Rules are circumvented, mistakenly or
otherwise. You need something to enforce the rules. Here again, humans
are poor performers. They get bored. They are biased. They can be
persuaded. They forget things. Computers don‚Äôt do this. It should go
without saying, but if the way you plan to enforce your rules is via a
human, it‚Äôs probably going to fall apart. Even if you documented the
rules. Even if the document has animated gifs, bold letters, and
threats. It just doesn‚Äôt work well.</p>
<p>The solution is to seek out what can be automated, and spend the time
to automate it. Ultimately, it‚Äôs the responsibility of the person (or
group) that defined the rules to make sure that the rules are enforced.
This means it‚Äôs their job to automate the enforcement, whether that‚Äôs
writing scripts, turning on commit hooks, or enabling lint checks.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-exceptions">What about exceptions?</h2>
<p>The problem with rules is that there are always exceptions. When the
rubber meets the road, when it‚Äôs 3 a.m. and the site is down and you
just need to get something fixed. You need to <em>consciously</em> and
<em>intentionally</em> circumvent the rules. But you‚Äôve just gone and
automated everything! You need to bake the exception flow into the
automation process.</p>
<p>At LinkedIn, we had the concept of an ‚Äú<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_control_list">ACL</a>
override‚Äù. You could execute an ACL override when committing code to a
repository that you didn‚Äôt normally have access to. After approval from
another engineer, the override was logged, and an email was sent to the
entire engineering organization to alert everyone that an override had
occurred. The tool was seldom used, but it was there in case it was
needed.</p>
<p>Make sure that automation allows for its circumvention, but does so
in a way that makes it clear that this is not normal. Causing the user a
little pain is fine, and arguably a good thing. Log and alert when a
circumvention occurs, and make it clear to the user what they‚Äôre trading
off by breaking the rules.</p>
<h2 id="limitations">Limitations</h2>
<p>Sadly, not all rule enforcement can be automated all the time.
Whenever a human being is required to make a qualitative judgement,
automation bumps up against its limits.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take <a href="http://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning</a> as an
example. Take a moment to review the website if you‚Äôre unfamiliar with
it. One of the rules from the website reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x &gt; 0) MUST be incremented if only
backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined as
an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Backwards compatibility is something that can be (<a
href="http://hisham.hm/2016/03/24/you-cant-automate-semver-or-there-is-no-way-around-rices-theorem/">kind
of</a>) automated and tested via a script (assuming there‚Äôs a rigorous
way to define a public API), so that‚Äôs good news. But what about this
claim about a bug fix being something that fixes incorrect behavior. Who
determines what a bug fix is versus what a feature is? One could try to
define a ‚Äúfeature‚Äù and ‚Äúbug fix‚Äù issue type in an issue tracker, and
link the issues to the commits. Transitively, this would connect the
issue type to the version bump, and automated checks could then verify
that ‚Äúfeature‚Äù issues are only resolved when a minor version bump
occurs, not a patch version. Still, who defines whether an issue is a
feature or a bug? Things get a bit wishy-washy.</p>
<p>Ultimately, some processes are just going to boil down to humans
making judgement calls. In these cases, automate what you can, but be
aware that you no longer have a rule‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääyou have a guideline. You can
still derive useful information, but it‚Äôs dependent on the quality of
the human judgements being made. This is where culture becomes
important. If people care about the output of the automation, they‚Äôll be
more likely to think about their decisions, and input things that make
sense.</p>
<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>
<p>Keep your eye out when engaged in conversations surrounding
guidelines in rules. If you‚Äôre in a meeting where people define the
end-point as documenting the rules, push back. Tell them to trust users
to read the rules, but automate the enforcement.</p>
