      <title>The Future of Data Engineering</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2019-07-29-future-data-engineering</link>
      <description>I have been thinking lately about where we’ve come in data engineering over the past few years, and about what the future holds for work in this area. Most of this thought has been framed in the context of what some of our teams are doing at WePay, but I believe the framework below applies more broadly, and is worth sharing.</description>

      <title>Trust, but automate</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2017-09-11-trust-but-automate</link>
      <description>If you want to enforce a technical guideline or rule, you must automate the enforcement mechanism. Relying on human beings to do the enforcement is too error prone, yet this is exactly the pattern that I see pop up again and again.</description>

      <title>Recap: A Data Catalog for People Who Hate Data Catalogs</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2023-01-05-recap-for-people-who-hate-data-catalogs</link>
      <description>I’m excited to release [Recap](https://github.com/recap-cloud/recap), a dead simple data catalog for engineers, written in Python. Recap makes it easy for engineers to build infrastructure and tools that need metadata. Unlike traditional data catalogs, Recap is designed to power software.</description>

      <title>Minimum viable infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2018-11-19-minimum-viable-infrastructure</link>
      <description>We've been discussing building some new infrastructure at work. The project involves writing some fresh code and interfacing with some other systems that we've never used before. There are a lot of unknowns. During a discussion about the project, I found myself making the statement, **"Your goal is to build the smallest amount of the system while still providing value to at least one user."**</description>

      <title>What the Heck is a Data Mesh?!</title>

Data meshes have clearly struck a nerve. Some don’t understand them, while others believe they’re a bad idea. Yet, "Demystifying Data Mesh" and "Putting Data Mesh to Work" articles abound.</description>

      <description>Design documents aren't just a chore; something that you begrudgingly slog through before getting to the fun work of writing code. Writing a design document might be challenging, but it should be a productive exercise that gets everyone on the same page. Let's start with what a design document is.</description>

      <title>Kafka Consumer Memory Tuning</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2012-10-05-kafka-consumer-memory-tuning</link>
      <description>Yesterday, I had a process that was consuming a single Kafka topic. I was running it in our "staging" environment, and everything worked great. My heap space for the process was set to 512 megabytes (`-Xmx512M`). When I moved this process to production, my process would fail with an out of memory exception. I was seeing:</description>

      <title>Kafka change data capture breaks database encapsulation</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2018-11-05-kafka-change-data-capture-breaks-database-encapsulation</link>
      <description>Realtime [change data capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Change_data_capture) (CDC) is becoming a popular architecture for [data integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_integration) and [data pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(computing)). The rise of [Kafka connect](https://docs.confluent.io/current/connect/index.html), in particular, has triggered a lot of interest in the subject. In realtime CDC, a database's changes (inserts, updates, and deletes) are available as a stream of mutations for downstream consumers to tail. This architecture is showing up a lot in modern ETL and data integration implementations, and it has a number of advantages:</description>

      <description>The lack of tooling available for managing Kafka topic configuration has been in the back of my mind for a while. It seems like a fairly obvious need, but there doesn't appear to be much available. Unsurprisingly, I'm not the only person to recognize this need:</description>

The story is a long form piece that's half character study, and half high-level biology. The article sparked my interest. Specifically, how engineering might be able to accelerate the way in which medical research is conducted.</description>

      <description>I was having lunch with a friend of mine recently where we were talking about a discussion he'd been having with a [QA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_assurance#Software_development) manager that he was interviewing. The discussion was about the role of QA in a modern engineering organization. The candidate had responded that they viewed their role like that of security. I found this really thought provoking, and I want to unpack it a little bit.</description>

      <description>When I first joined LinkedIn, there was very little automation in production deployments. Believe it or not, each deployment day had a wiki page with a run book of all the services that needed to be deployed, complete with configuration changes that needed to be executed. Roll outs happened on Thursday evenings, and the entire site was brought offline during the deployments. Metrics and monitoring weren't much better. We had very limited visibility into metrics and logs. Obviously, this caused a bunch of problems for the engineers. For one thing, it meant that we had to rely heavily on the operations staff anytime we needed to do just about anything.</description>

      <title>Killing Subprocesses in Linux/Bash</title>
      <link>https://cnr.sh/essays/2012-09-25-kill-subprocesses-linux-bash</link>
      <description>Lately, I've been working with [YARN](http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r0.23.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/YARN.html) at LinkedIn. This framework allows you to execute Bash scripts on one or more machines. It's used primarily for Hadoop. When using YARN, you often end up with nested Bash scripts with no parent process ID (PPID) when the NodeManager launches the Bash script. This can be pretty problematic when the NodeManager is shut down, since you must make sure to clean up all child subprocesses via your parent Bash script.</description>
