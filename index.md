Hi! I'm Chris Riccomini, a software engineer, author, investor, and advisor.

I like writing [Essays](/essays) and giving [Talks](/talks). Subscribe to my [TinyLetter](https://tinyletter.com/criccomini) <i class="fas fa-heart"></i> and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/criccomini) <i class="fab fa-twitter"></i> for updates!

I've worked at WePay, LinkedIn, and PayPal. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccomini/) <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i> has my complete work history.

I'm into open source. I wrote [Apache Samza](https://samza.apache.org) and I'm on [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org)'s PMC. I don't write code as I used to, but my contributions are on [Github](https://github.com/criccomini) <i class="fab fa-github"></i>.

I'm an investor and advisor in a few startups. You can find them on my [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/criccomini) <i class="fab fa-angellist"></i> profile.

My papers and patents are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eVpA7pQAAAAJ&hl=en) <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>, but they aren't really _mine_; they're a team effort.

I like reading, too. Check out my book list on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39364006-chris-riccomini) <i class="fab fa-goodreads"></i>. If shorter reads are more your thing, I share links on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@criccomini) <i class="fab fa-get-pocket"></i>.
