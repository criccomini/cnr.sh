Hi! I'm Chris, a software engineer, author, and investor.

I write [posts](posts/index.md) and give [talks](talks.md). Subscribe to my [newsletter](https://materializedview.io) or follow me on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/chris.blue) <i class="fab fa-bluesky"></i> for updates!

I run [Materialized View Capital](https://materializedview.capital) <i class="fas fa-bank"></i>. It's a small fund that invests in early stage infrastructure and developer tool companies. I used to invest personally. You can find those companies on my [AngelList](https://angel.co/u/criccomini) <i class="fab fa-angellist"></i> profile.

I'm into open source. My current project is [SlateDB](https://slatedb.io), an embedded key-value store built on object storage. I previously wrote [Apache Samza](https://samza.apache.org) and I'm on [Apache Airflow](https://airflow.apache.org)'s PMC. You can follow me on [Github](https://github.com/criccomini) <i class="fab fa-github"></i>.

I've worked at WePay, LinkedIn, and PayPal. [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riccomini/) <i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i> has my complete work history.

My first book is out! [The Missing README](https://nostarch.com/missing-readme) <i class="fas fa-book"></i> is a guide for new software engineers. You can get it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Missing-README-Guide-Software-Engineer/dp/1718501838) <i class="fab fa-amazon"></i>.

Some papers and patents that I've been included in are on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=eVpA7pQAAAAJ&hl=en) <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>.

I like reading, too. Check out my book list on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39364006-chris-riccomini) <i class="fab fa-goodreads"></i>. If shorter reads are more your thing, I share links on [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/@criccomini) <i class="fab fa-get-pocket"></i>.
